# Blogs-Medium
This project is a full-stack blogging platform inspired by Medium, designed to demonstrate modern web development practices and real-world application structure. The frontend is built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, delivering a clean and responsive user interface that includes authentication pages, blog listing, individual blog viewing, and content publishing features. On the backend, Hono and Prisma are used to create structured REST APIs connected to a database, enabling secure user signup and signin, JWT-based authentication, and protected routes for managing blog content. Axios handles communication between the frontend and backend, ensuring authenticated requests through authorization headers.
The application highlights essential full-stack development concepts such as API design, authentication and authorization, client-side state management using React hooks, routing, and seamless database integration. By combining these technologies into a single cohesive system, the project serves as a practical learning experience for understanding how scalable blogging platforms are built. It reflects industry-relevant architecture, secure data handling, and user-focused design, making it a strong foundation for developing more advanced full-stack web applications in the future.
